# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-AI
Pneumonia Detection System is a AI based Project in which weh have used a convolutional neural network model trained from scratch to classify and detect the presence of pneumonia from a collection of chest X-ray image samples. We have used the x-ray images data in our model. We have constructed our own convolutional neural network model from scratch to extract features from a given chest X-ray image and classify it to determine if a person is infected with pneumonia.
The pneumonia affected parts of the lung would be detected using computer vision. An optimum solution for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-rays is proposed in this project.
